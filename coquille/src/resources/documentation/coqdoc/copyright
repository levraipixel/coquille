                      *Open Publication License*
                           v1.0, 8 June 1999


*I. REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS*

The Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole or
in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the terms
of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an
incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by the
author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.

Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:

    Copyright (c) <year> by <author's name or designee>. This material
    may be distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set
    forth in the Open Publication License, vX.Y or later (the latest
    version is presently available at http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/).

The reference must be immediately followed with any options elected by
the author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see section VI).

Commercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is
permitted.

Any publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the citation
of the original publisher and author. The publisher and author's names
shall appear on all outer surfaces of the book. On all outer surfaces of
the book the original publisher's name shall be as large as the title of
the work and cited as possessive with respect to the title.


*II. COPYRIGHT*

The copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or
designee.


*III. SCOPE OF LICENSE*

The following license terms apply to all Open Publication works, unless
otherwise explicitly stated in the document.

Mere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open
Publication work with other works or programs on the same media shall
not cause this license to apply to those other works. The aggregate work
shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication
material and appropriate copyright notice.

SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable
in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in force.

NO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided "as is"
without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.


*IV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS*

All modified versions of documents covered by this license, including
translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet
the following requirements:

   1. The modified version must be labeled as such.
   2. The person making the modifications must be identified and the
      modifications dated.
   3. Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable
      must be retained according to normal academic citation practices.
   4. The location of the original unmodified document must be identified.
   5. The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to
      assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the
      original author's (or authors') permission. 


*V. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS *

In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from
and strongly recommended of redistributors that:

   1. If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or
      CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your
      intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript
      or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated
      documents. This notification should describe modifications, if
      any, made to the document.
   2. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either
      clearly marked up in the document or else described in an
      attachment to the document.
   3. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is
      considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and
      CD-ROM expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its
      author(s).


*VI. LICENSE OPTIONS*

The author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document
may elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or
copy of the license. These options are considered part of the license
instance and must be included with the license (or its incorporation by
reference) in derived works.

A. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions without
the explicit permission of the author(s). "Substantive modification" is
defined as a change to the semantic content of the document, and
excludes mere changes in format or typographical corrections.

To accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively
modified versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit
permission of the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.

B. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in whole
or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes is
prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.

To accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or
derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited
unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.' to the
license reference or copy.
